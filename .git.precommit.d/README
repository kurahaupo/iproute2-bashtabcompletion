PRE-COMMIT CHECKING.

To activate, in the root of the repo run:
    ln -svf ../../.git.precommit.d/pre-commit .git/hooks/

Wheneven a "git commit" is attempted, if the ".git/hooks/pre-commit" script
exists, it is run, and must "pass" (return status 0) for the commit to proceed.

If the "pre-commit" in this directory script is copied (or linked) there, it
will in turn invoke each of the test scripts in this directory, and will only
permit the commit to proceed if all of them "pass".

Ideally there should be a test script for each function or method.

(Test scripts must be executable and have names that start with a digit and end
with an alphanumeric are considered, so backups ending in '~', the "pre-commit"
script, and this README are not considered.)
